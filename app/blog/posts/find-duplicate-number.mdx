Given an array of integers nums containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive. There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

```
Example 1:
Input -> nums = [1,3,4,2,2], Output -> 2

Example 2:
Input -> nums = [3,1,3,4,2], Output -> 3
```

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.

### Approach 1: Brute Force (Nested Loops)

Use nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs and as soon as you find a pair with equal numbers, return that number. 

### Algorithm

```python
- for i in range: [0, n-1):
    - for j in range: [i+1, n):
        - if nums[i] == nums[j]: return nums[i];
- return -1;
```

### Time complexity

In the worst case scenario, i.e., when `nums[n-2]` and `nums[n-1]` represent the duplicate pair, we may iterate over all possible pairs. Hence, overall time complexity = `O(n^2)`.

### Space Complexity

We are not using any extra space. Hence, overall space complexity = `O(1)`.

### Approach 2: Floyd’s Tortoise & Hare (Trick)

Treat the `nums` array as a linked list, where each index is a node and each value points to the next node. 

The duplicated number is the node with two incoming connections and corresponds to the entry point of the cycle, which can be found using slow and fast pointers.

### Algorithm

```python
slow = nums[0]
fast = nums[nums[i]]

# Phase 1: Detect Cycle 
while slow != fast:
    slow = nums[slow]
    fast = nums[nums[fast]]

# Phase 2: Find the entry point
finder = nums[0]
while finder != slow:
    slow = nums[slow]
    finder = nums[finder]

return finder
```

### Time Complexity

Both the phases traverse the array linear number of times. Hence, overall time complexity = `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity

We didn't use any extra space. Hence, overall space complexity = `O(n)`.
