Design a **Hotel Reservation System** that allows users to seamlessly search and book hotels, ensuring a smooth and reliable travel experience while handling scale, performance, and reliability challenges behind the scenes.

![hotel-booking-system](/hotel-reservation-system/hotel-booking-system.png)

---

### Functional Requirements

The following are the core functional requirements of the system:

1. Enable users to search for hotels based on preferences such as location and travel dates.

2. Support the complete booking flow, including room selection, reservation creation, and booking confirmation.

3. Provide secure payment handling with multiple methods, such as credit/debit cards, UPI, wallets, and net banking.

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

The following are the core non-functional requirements of the system:

1. The system must **support high volumes of concurrent users, searches, and bookings**, with the ability to scale horizontally during peak travel seasons.

2. Search results should be delivered with low latency (e.g., &lt;500 ms for p95), however, it's acceptable for the system to take a few seconds to process a reservation request.

3. Backup and failover mechanisms must exist to recover data and operations quickly in case of outages or regional failures.

---

### Load Estimation

The **Hotel Reservation System** serves as a platform connecting **customers** and **hotels**, handling all stages of the reservation process such as **searching for hotels**, **viewing hotel and room details**, and **making reservations**.

Let’s discuss each use case in detail to gain a clear understanding of the system’s functionality and to evaluate the scale and capacity the platform needs to support.

#### Use Case 1: Search Hotels

Enables **customers** to **search for available hotels** based on their specified **location** and **check-in / check-out dates**.

```markdown
- Assumption: Daily Active Users (DAU) = 5 Million
- Assumption: Average Search Requests per User per Day = 5

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 5 = 25M
- Average RPS = 25,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 250 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 250 * 5 ≈ 1,250 RPS
```

> This is a **read-heavy**, **latency-sensitive** query workload (high QPS with spiky peaks).

#### Use Case 2: View Hotel Details

Enables **customers** to **view complete details of a selected hotel**, including **amenities**, **images**, **policies**, and **room-type availability** for the specified check-in and check-out dates.

```markdown
- Assumption: 50% of users view details after search
- Assumption: Average View Details Requests per User per Day = 2

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 50% * 2 = 5,000,000
- Average RPS = 5,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 50 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 50 * 5 ≈ 250 RPS
```

> This is a **read-heavy** details query (medium QPS). 

#### Use Case 3: Make Reservations

Enables **customers** to **select a hotel and room type**, provide guest details, complete payment, and receive a confirmed booking.

```
- Assumption: 2% of users make a booking per day
- Assumption: Average Booking Requests per User per Day = 1

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 2% = 100,000
- Average RPS = 100,000 / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 1 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 1 * 5 = 5 RPS
```

> This is a classic low-QPS, high-risk use case.

---

### Design Rationale

The use cases exhibit **very different operational characteristics** in terms of traffic volume, read/write patterns, and consistency requirements.

| Use Case           | Avg RPS | Peak RPS | Nature                           |
| ------------------ | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Search Hotels      | 250     | 1250     | Read-heavy, cache-driven         |
| View Hotel Details | 50      | 250      | Read-heavy, aggregation          |
| Make Reservations   | 1       | 5        | Write-heavy, strongly consistent |

These differences make it impractical to serve all use cases through a monolithic architecture.

To avoid tightly coupled workloads with vastly different scalability, latency, and consistency requirements, we will adopt a **microservices architecture**, where each major use case is implemented as an independent service. 

This allows high-traffic, read-heavy services such as search to scale horizontally and leverage caching, while low-traffic but critical workflows like reservations can enforce strong transactional guarantees without being impacted by unrelated load.

---

### Sequence Flow

Let’s understand the **step-by-step sequence flow of each of the core use cases** to gain deeper insights into how the system works in practice.

#### Use Case 1: Search Hotels

A straightforward approach would be to let a single `SearchService` own all data required for hotel search. However, a search query inherently requires combining **two fundamentally different categories of data**. 

- On one side, it relies on relatively static information such as hotel names, locations, images, amenities, policies, and room-type definitions, that changes infrequently and can be aggressively cached. 

- On the other side, it depends on highly dynamic data like room availability and pricing, which can change frequently due to bookings, demand fluctuations, or pricing rules.

Treating both data types uniformly forces the system to optimize for the most volatile data, which increases latency, reduces cache effectiveness, and wastes compute resources. To avoid this, the system can be decomposed into specialized services. 

- A dedicated `HotelService` can manage stable hotel profile content and be optimized for read-heavy access and aggressive caching. 

- An `InventoryService` can handle fast-changing room availability with a focus on freshness and concurrency control, while a `PricingService` can manage dynamic pricing logic and frequent updates.

- The `SearchService` can then act as an **orchestrator**, coordinating calls to these backend services, retrieving static and dynamic data in parallel, and aggregating the results into a unified search response.

The following interactions describe the step-by-step flow between the **user interface** and the **backend components** during this operation:

1. The `Customer` enters the search criteria such as `location`, `checkInDate`,  `checkOutDate` and submits the **Search Hotels** form.

2. The `Frontend` sends a `GET /hotels/hotel-listings` request to the `SearchService`, including all the selected form parameters: `location`, `checkInDate` and `checkOutDate`.

3. The `SearchService` coordinates with downstream services to determine hotel availability and pricing.  

	- **Hotel Lookup**: Sends a GET request to the `HotelService` to fetch all hotels listed for the selected `location`.  

	- **Availability Check**: For the list of hotels returned, it queries the `InventoryService` to identify hotels with at least one available room for the specified `checkInDate` and `checkOutDate`.

	- **Pricing Calculation**: For hotels with availability, it calls the `PricingService` to retrieve the `avgPerNightPrice` for the selected date range.

4. After aggregating hotel metadata, availability, and pricing information, the `SearchService` caches the final response (short TTL) and returns a list of available hotels to the `Frontend`.

5. The `Frontend` renders the response as a grid of `Hotel` cards, displaying key details such as: `hotelName`, `avgPricePerNight`, `availability`, `rating`, etc.

![hotel-booking-system](/hotel-reservation-system/search-hotels-sequence-diagram.png)

This design allows each service to scale independently, minimizes performance interference, and ensures fast search responses without compromising the accuracy required for downstream booking flows.

#### Use Case 2: View Hotel Details

The **View Hotel Details** use case differs from **Search Hotels** in both **scope and load characteristics**. While hotel search is optimized for high-volume traffic and aggregated results across many hotels, viewing hotel details is a **low-volume, deep read** focused on a single hotel. This interaction typically involves richer data such as detailed descriptions, images, amenities, policies, and room-level information.

Unlike the Search Hotels flow, where the `SearchService` acts as an orchestrator, the **frontend can directly coordinate** with the `HotelService`, `InventoryService`, and `PricingService` to render the hotel details page.

The following interactions describe the step-by-step flow between the **user interface** and the **backend components** during this operation:

The following interactions describe the step-by-step flow between the **user interface** and the **backend components** during this operation:

1. The `Customer` selects a hotel from the search results on the user interface.

2. The `Frontend` issues **three asynchronous requests** in parallel:

	- Sends a `GET /hotels/{hotelId}` request to the `HotelService` to retrieve static hotel information such as the hotel name, descriptions, amenities, and policies (typically served from cache, with database fallback).

	- Sends a `POST /availability` request to the `InventoryService` to retrieve room-level availability for the selected date range.

	- Sends a `POST /pricing` request to the `PricingService` to calculate and fetch pricing details for each available room type.

3. The `Frontend` aggregates responses from the `HotelService`, `InventoryService`, and `PricingService`, and renders the **Hotel Details Page**, displaying hotel profile information along with available room types and their corresponding prices.


![hotel-booking-system](/hotel-reservation-system/view-hotel-details-sequence-flow.png)

This approach avoids unnecessary backend orchestration, reduces end-to-end latency, and simplifies the request flow, while still preserving clean service boundaries and strict data ownership.

#### Use Case 3: Make Reservations

Using a single `ReservationService` to handle the entire booking lifecycle (inventory locking, payment coordination, reservation confirmation) may appear simpler, but it introduces significant architectural drawbacks. 

The reservation flow involves **multiple domains with very different reliability, latency, and consistency characteristics**, particularly inventory management and payment processing. Coupling these responsibilities into a single service increases complexity, enlarges the failure blast radius, and makes it harder to reason about correctness and recovery.

To address these issues, the reservation workflow can be designed as a **two-part process with split orchestration responsibilities**.

##### **Phase 1: Reservation Initiation & Inventory Hold**

The `ReservationService` can orchestrate the booking initiation and inventory locking phase. It can coordinate with the `InventoryService` to place a **temporary hold** on the selected inventory, preventing double booking while payment is in progress.

The following interactions describe the step-by-step flow between the **user interface** and the **backend components** during this operation:


1. The `Customer` selects one or more **room types** and clicks **Book Now** on the user interface.

2. The `Frontend` sends a `POST /reservations` request to the `ReservationService`, including `requestId (idempotency key)`, `hotelId`, `checkInDate`, `checkOutDate` and selected room types with quantities  (e.g., `{ roomTypeA: 2, roomTypeB: 1 }`).

3. The `ReservationService` first checks whether a reservation already exists for the given `requestId`:

	- If a matching reservation exists, it returns the existing response.

	- If not, it creates a **new reservation record** in the **INITIATED** state.

4. The `ReservationService` then calls the `InventoryService` with a **single batch request** to place **temporary holds** for all selected room types and quantities for the given date range.

5. The `InventoryService` verifies availability for **each room type and requested quantity**:

	- If sufficient inventory exists for all requested rooms, it places a **temporary inventory hold** and returns a hold confirmation.

	- If any room type cannot be fulfilled, the request fails and no holds are created.

6. On successful hold creation, the `ReservationService` updates the reservation record with  the hold details, expiration timestamp, and transitions it to the **PENDING_PAYMENT** state.

7. Finally, the `ReservationService` returns the `reservationId` along with inventory hold details and the hold expiration timestamp to the frontend, enabling the user to proceed with payment.

![hotel-booking-system](/hotel-reservation-system/reservation-initialization-sequence-flow.png)

##### **Phase 2: Payment Confirmation & Reservation Finalization**

Payment processing depends on **external systems** that are inherently unreliable and slow. Payment gateways may time out, send duplicate callbacks, or complete payments asynchronously. Handling retries, idempotency, webhook verification, and reconciliation are therefore **core responsibilities of the `PaymentService`**, not the `ReservationService`.

By allowing the `PaymentService` to orchestrate this phase, payment-related failures and retries are **isolated from critical reservation state**, preventing gateway instability from corrupting booking data. The `PaymentService` can independently verify the payment with the external gateway, coordinate with the `InventoryService` to finalize the inventory hold, and then invoke the `ReservationService` to **confirm the reservation**. 

This sequencing guarantees that reservations are finalized **only after successful payment**, while keeping payment-specific failure handling fully decoupled from core booking logic.

The following interactions describe the step-by-step flow between the **user interface** and the **backend components** during this operation:

1. The `Customer` clicks **Pay Now** on the user interface after reviewing the reservation details.

2. The `Frontend` sends a `POST /payments` request to the `PaymentService`, including the `reservationId`.

3. The `PaymentService` validates the request, performs an **idempotency check**, creates a **payment order** with the external payment gateway and returns the **checkout URL along with the payment order details** to the `Frontend`.

4. The `Frontend` redirects the `Customer` to the **payment gateway checkout page** to complete the payment.

5. After the payment is completed, the frontend calls `POST /payments/confirm` on the `PaymentService` with the `reservationId` and payment verification details.

6. The `PaymentService` verifies the payment status with the payment gateway. Upon successful payment verification, the `PaymentService` calls the `InventoryService` to **finalize the inventory hold**, converting the temporary hold into a permanent allocation.

7. After inventory finalization succeeds, the `PaymentService` calls the `ReservationService` to **confirm the reservation**, transitioning it from **PENDING_PAYMENT** to **CONFIRMED**.

8. The `PaymentService` records the final payment state and responds to the `Frontend` with a successful booking confirmation.
    
9. The `Frontend` updates the `Customer`, displaying the booking confirmation and completion status.

![hotel-booking-system](/hotel-reservation-system/payment-processing-sequence-flow.png)

This split orchestration model improves **fault isolation, scalability, and correctness**, while keeping service responsibilities clean and aligned with their respective domains.

### API Design

Let’s discuss the **API design of the core services** in detail, examining the main endpoints each service exposes, the request and response models they use, and the reasoning behind the underlying business logic. 

This helps clarify how responsibilities are distributed across services and how they interact to support the reservation flow.

#### Hotel Service

The **Hotel Service** is responsible for owning and serving **static hotel profile data**. This data changes infrequently, is optimized for read-heavy access through aggressive caching with long TTLs, and intentionally excludes dynamic information such as availability and pricing.

Let's discuss the key endpoints exposed by the Reservation Service.

##### `1. GET /hotels`

Returns a list of hotels for a given location.

**Request Parameters**

| Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| locationId | String | Yes      | City or location identifier (e.g., city code or name) |

**Sample Request**

```json
GET /hotels?location=BLR
```

**Business Logic**

```java
@Cacheable(
	value = "hotelsByLocation",
	key = "#locationId",
	unless = "#result.isEmpty()"
)
public List<HotelView> getHotelsByLocation(String locationId) {

	return hotelRepository.findByLocation(locationId)
			.stream()
			.map(HotelView::from)
			.toList();
}
```

**Sample Response**

```json
[
  {
    "hotelId": 101,
    "name": "Grand Goa Resort",
    "description": "A luxury seaside resort offering modern rooms, infinity 
				    pool, and beach access.",
    "locationId": "GOA",
    "address": "Candolim Beach Road, Goa, India",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/101/thumb.jpg",
    "rating": 4.6,
    "amenities": ["wifi", "pool", "gym", "spa"]
  },
  {
    "hotelId": 102,
    "name": "Westin Resort",
    "description": "Premium 5-star property featuring private beach, fine 
					dining, and wellness spa.",
    "locationId": "GOA",
    "address": "Arpora Beach Road, Goa, India",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/102/thumb.jpg",
    "rating": 4.7,
    "amenities": ["wifi", "pool", "private beach", "restaurant", "bar"]
  }
]
```

This endpoint is **read-optimized** and used primarily by the **Search Service** to fetch static hotel metadata.

##### `2. GET /hotels/{hotelId}`

Returns the full hotel profile for a given hotel.

**Sample Request**

```json
GET /hotels/H123
```

**Business Logic**

```java
@Cacheable(
	value = "hotelDetails",
	key = "#hotelId"
)
public HotelDetailsResponse getHotelDetails(String hotelId) {

	Hotel hotel = hotelRepository.findByHotelId(hotelId)
			.orElseThrow(() -> new NotFoundException("Hotel not found"));

	return HotelDetailsResponse.from(hotel);
}
```

**Sample Response**

```json
{
  "hotelId": "H123",
  "name": "Ocean View Hotel",
  "location": "Bangalore",
  "description": "A beachfront hotel offering scenic views and premium amenities.",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "amenities": [
    "Free Wi-Fi",
    "Swimming Pool",
    "Breakfast Included",
    "Parking"
  ],
  "imageUrls": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/hotels/H123/1.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/hotels/H123/2.jpg"
  ],
  "policies": {
    "checkInTime": "14:00",
    "checkOutTime": "11:00",
    "cancellation": "Free cancellation up to 24 hours before check-in"
  },
  "roomTypes": [
    {
      "code": "DELUXE",
      "name": "Deluxe Room",
      "capacity": 2,
      "description": "Spacious room with sea view"
    },
    {
      "code": "STANDARD",
      "name": "Standard Room",
      "capacity": 2,
      "description": "Comfortable room with city view"
    }
  ]
}
```

This endpoint serves **static, read-only hotel metadata** required to render the hotel details page.

#### Inventory Service

#### Pricing Service

#### Search Service

The **Search Service** is responsible for handling the **Search Hotels** use case. It acts as a read-optimized, high-throughput service that aggregates data from multiple downstream services to return fast and relevant search results.

Below, we discuss the key endpoints exposed by the Search Service.

##### 1. `GET /hotels/hotel-listings`

Returns a read-optimized list of available hotels for a given location and date range by aggregating hotel metadata, availability, and pricing.

**Request Parameters**

| Parameter    | Type   | Description         |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------- |
| locationId   | string | location identifier |
| checkInDate  | date   | Check-in date       |
| checkOutDate | date   | Check-out date      |

**Sample Request**

```json
GET /hotels/hotel-listings?locationId=BLR&checkInDate=2025-03-10&checkOutDate=2025-03-12
```

**Business Logic**

```java
public List<SearchHotelView> searchHotels(
	Long locationId, 
	LocalDate checkInDate, 
	LocalDate checkOutDate
) {

	// 1. Cache lookup (short TTL)
	List<SearchHotelView> cached = cache.get(request);
	if (cached != null) {
		return cached;
	}

	// 2. Fetch hotels for location
	List<HotelDTO> hotels =
			hotelClient.getHotelsByLocation(locationId);

	if (hotels.isEmpty()) {
		return Collections.emptyList();
	}

	List<Long> hotelIds =
			hotels.stream().map(HotelDTO::getHotelId).toList();

	// 3. Batch availability check
	AvailabilityResponse availability =
			inventoryClient.checkAvailability(
					hotelIds,
					request.getCheckInDate(),
					request.getCheckOutDate()
			);

	// 4. Filter available hotels
	List<String> availableHotelIds =
			availability.getAvailableHotelIds();

	if (availableHotelIds.isEmpty()) {
		return Collections.emptyList();
	}

	// 5. Batch pricing call
	Map<String, BigDecimal> pricing =
			pricingClient.getAvgPrices(
					availableHotelIds,
					request.getCheckInDate(),
					request.getCheckOutDate()
			);

	// 6. Aggregate response
	List<SearchHotelView> results = hotels.stream()
			.filter(h -> availableHotelIds.contains(h.getHotelId()))
			.map(h -> SearchHotelView.from(h, pricing.get(h.getHotelId())))
			.toList();

	// 7. Cache result (short TTL)
	cache.put(request, response);

	return results;
}
```

**Sample Response**

```json
[
  {
    "hotelId": 101,
    "name": "Grand Goa Resort",
    "address": "Candolim Beach Road, Goa, India",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/101/thumb.jpg",
    "rating": 4,
    "avgPricePerNight": 4500,
  },
  {
    "hotelId": 102,
    "name": "City Budget Inn",
    "address": "MG Road, Bengaluru, India",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/102/thumb.jpg",
    "rating": 3,
    "avgPricePerNight": 2200,
  }
]
```

#### Reservation Service

The **Reservation Service** is responsible for managing the **booking lifecycle**, including reservation creation, inventory locking coordination, and reservation state transitions. 

It owns the **reservation state machine** and ensures that bookings are created safely before payment is initiated. Below are the **reservation states** managed by the Reservation Service:

- `INITIATED`: Reservation record created (idempotency anchor)
- `PENDING_PAYMENT`: Inventory successfully held, awaiting payment
- `CONFIRMED`: Booking finalized after successful payment
- `EXPIRED` / `FAILED`: Reservation invalidated due to timeout or failure

Now, let's discuss the key endpoints exposed by the Reservation Service.

##### 1. `POST /reservations`

Creates a new reservation request and initiates **Phase 1: Reservation Initiation & Inventory Hold**.

**Request Parameters**

| Field        | Type   | Description                          |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| requestId    | string | Client-generated idempotency key     |
| hotelId      | string | Selected hotel identifier            |
| checkInDate  | date   | Check-in date                        |
| checkOutDate | date   | Check-out date                       |
| rooms        | map    | Room types with requested quantities |

**Sample Request**

```json
{
  "requestId": "req-12345",
  "hotelId": "H123",
  "checkInDate": "2025-03-10",
  "checkOutDate": "2025-03-12",
  "rooms": {
	"DELUXE": 2,
	"STANDARD": 1
  }
}
```

**Business Logic**

```java
@Transactional
public Reservation createReservation(
	String requestId, 
    Long hotelId, 
    LocalDate checkInDate,
    LocalDate checkOutDate,
    Map<String, Integer> rooms,
) {

	// 1. Idempotency check
	Optional<Reservation> existing =
			reservationRepository.findByRequestId(requestId);

	if (existing.isPresent()) {
		return ReservationResponse.from(existing.get());
	}

	// 2. Create reservation record (INITIATED)
	Reservation reservation = Reservation.builder()
			.requestId(requestId)
			.hotelId(getHotelId)
			.checkInDate(checkInDate)
			.checkOutDate(checkOutDate)
			.rooms(rooms)
			.status(ReservationStatus.INITIATED)
			.build();

	reservationRepository.save(reservation);

	// 3. Call InventoryService (batch hold)
	InventoryHoldResponse holdResponse =
			inventoryClient.placeHold(
					InventoryHoldRequest.from(reservation)
			);

	// 4. Update reservation on successful hold
	reservation.setStatus(ReservationStatus.PENDING_PAYMENT);
	reservation.setHoldId(holdResponse.getHoldId());
	reservation.setHoldExpiresAt(holdResponse.getExpiresAt());

	reservationRepository.save(reservation);

	return reservation;
}
```

**Sample Response**

```json
{
  "reservationId": "R789",
  "status": "PENDING_PAYMENT",
  "inventoryHold": {
    "holdId": "HOLD456",
    "expiresAt": "2025-03-10T12:15:00Z"
  }
}
```

`@Transactional` guarantees that the idempotency check, reservation record creation, and state transition from `INITIATED` to `PENDING_PAYMENT` are committed together, preventing partially persisted or inconsistent booking state. 

If any step fails, the transaction is rolled back automatically, preserving data integrity.

##### 2. `POST /reservations/{reservationId}/confirm`

Confirms a reservation after successful payment.

**Sample Request**

```json
{
  "paymentId": "pay_987654",
  "orderId": "order_123456",
  "paymentProvider": "RAZORPAY",
  "paidAt": "2025-03-10T10:15:30Z"
}
```

**Business Logic**

```
```

**Sample Response**

```json
{
  "reservationId": "R789",
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "confirmedAt": "2025-03-10T10:15:35Z"
}
```

This endpoint is invoked by the PaymentService during Phase 2: Payment Processing & Reservation Confirmation to finalize the booking.
