Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. 
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Consider the number of unique elements in `nums` to be `k`​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements `k`.

> **NOTE:** The first `k` elements of `nums` should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index `k - 1` can be ignored.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

### Two Pointers Technique

Iterate over `nums` using one pointer `i`. Maintain another pointer `k` that keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

Whenever we encounter a unique element (comparing the current element with the previous one), overwrite the next position at `index = k` and increment `k` forward. 
By the end of the iteration, the first `k` indices will contain all unique elements.

> **NOTE**: Considering `nums` is sorted, the element at `index = 0` will represent the smallest unique element.

#### Algorithm

```java
- k = 1;

- for i in range = [1, nums.length]:
    - if nums[i-1] != nums[i]:
        - nums[k] = nums[i];
        - k = k + 1;
        
return k;
```

#### Time Complexity

We will only iterate the array once. Hence, overall time complexity = `O(n)`.

#### Space Complexity

We are not using any extra space. Hence, overall space complexity = `O(1)`.
