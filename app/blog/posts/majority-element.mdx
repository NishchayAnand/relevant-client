Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element, i.e., the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋`times.

```
Example 1:
    Input -> nums = [3,2,3]
    Output -> 3

Example 2:
    Input -> nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
    Output -> 2
```

### Assumptions

<span className="text-indigo-700">**Q.** Will the majority element always exist in the input array?</span>\
**A. Yes,** you can assume that a majority element will always be there.

### Approach 1: Frequency Map

We can use a hash map to count the frequency of each element in the array. As we iterate through the array, we increment the count for each element. If any element's count exceeds `[n / 2]`, we immediately return the element as the majority element.

#### Algorithm

```python
- n = nums.length;
- freqMap = {}; // empty hash map to store element frequencies
- for num in nums:
    - if num exists in freqMap:
        - freqMap[num] = freqMap[num] + 1;
    - else:
        - freqMap[num] = 1;
    - if freqMap[num] > n / 2:
        - return num;
```

#### Time complexity

We iterate through the array once, and hash map operations (insert and lookup) take `O(1)` time on average. Hence, overall time complexity = `O(n)`. 

#### Space Complexity

In the worst case, we might store all unique elements in the hash map. Hence, overall space complexity = `O(n)`.

### Approach 2: Sorting

If we sort the `nums` array, it is guaranteed that the middle element at `index = n/2` is our majority element.

### Algorithm

```python
- n = nums.length;
- sorted_nums = sorted(nums);
- return sorted_nums[n/2];
```

### Time Complexity

Time complexity of sorting an array of length `n` is `O(nlogn)`. Hence, overall time complexity = `O(nlogn)`.

### Space Complexity

We are not using any extra space. Hence, overall space complexity = `O(1)`.
